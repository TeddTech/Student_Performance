This project uses the ![Student Performance Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance) (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance) from the UCI machine learning repositiry.

Do females perform better than males in school given all other factors are the same? And what is the most influential factor that decides how well a student performs.

### 3.
The average performance of female students differ from the average perfromace of male students.

### 4.
I plan to use R to wrangle the data organize and create new features if necessary. I will also have a summary table summarizing key statistics. I plan on using a boxplot for my first visulization and a interaction plot built using ggplot `geom_line()` function. Other methods I may use to visualize the data may include a dot plot and bat chart.
